# This is a repository containg my own solutions to the famous book *The C Programming Langauge* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. These solutions are nothing new, but nonetheless, I will be putting them out there to showcase my growth in the language as I go through the book


## All code contained herewithin is my own, and only contains the .C or .H files, no executibles.
